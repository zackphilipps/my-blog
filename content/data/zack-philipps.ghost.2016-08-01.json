Even with the fact that Safari looks incredible on Yosemite (even better in full-screen mode), I still have to use Chrome. I really look forward to the day when Google brings Material Design to desktop Chrome. I think that would look and feel much better on Yosemite.\n\nI have to make the distinction with \"Beta\" here, because using the beta version ensures that I'm at least one step ahead of what my clients are using. This makes troubleshooting errors due to browser updates a more preemptive process for me. I don't like to use Canary, the bleeding-edge version, because key components of it can break from time to time and impede my workflow.\n\nOf course within Chrome or any browser, there's a whole slew of other stuff you can talk about like extensions and the web apps you use, but [I'll save that for another post.](http://zackphilipps.com/how-i-use-chrome-to-run-a-web-design-business/)\n\n#### Transmit\n\nWow, it's simply the best FTP client out there. Period. It's great for Mac users because it's only available for Mac (:P), and actually looks and behaves like a Finder window.\n\nWhy is it the best? It's simple to configure and use, you can save and sync connections on all your devices via Dropbox, and you can't beat the ability to double-click files on a remote server and have them automatically open up for editing in your favorite text editor. Then, when you save your edits, the remote file is automatically overwritten, eliminate the painfully endless loop of dragging and dropping. Oh, and it's extremely fast. (Obviously not as fast as just using the command line, but hey, take what you can get.)\n\n#### Sublime Text\n\nI love to customize things, which makes me greatly appreciate any software that lets me do it. Sublime is extremely customizable, and it's easy! You can set your own preferences and key-bindings. Plus, there is a huge, thriving community of developers that have made packages, themes, and color schemes for Sublime. I can and should talk about [my Sublime setup in another post](http://zackphilipps.com/a-front-end-developers-sublime-text-setup).\n\nSublime is also the fastest-launching text editor I have ever used. I hated waiting on Brackets / Edge Code to open up when I used them.\n\n#### iTerm\n\niTerm is great because it's basically Mac OS's Terminal with several simple improvements. I love the fact that I can just quit the app and know it will automatically log me out of all my sessions. This makes shutting down my Mac a breeze (`ctrl+option+cmd+eject`).\n\nThe glue that holds Sublime and iTerm together though, and the main reason I use them, is [Mathias's dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles). Having set those up, I can type `s path/to/directory` to open an entire project in Sublime. I can also type in `emptytrash` to \"Empty the Trash on all mounted volumes and the main HDD, and also clear Apple’s System Logs to improve shell startup speed\", and then `cleanup` to recursively remove all `.DS_Store` files. I can also simply type `update` to single-commandedly get OS X Software Updates, and update installed Ruby gems, Homebrew, npm, and their installed packages. These are just a few of the aliases I use frequently that I have Mathias (and contributors to his GitHub repo) to thank for. Not to mention the awesome OSX, iTerm, and Sublime preferences and settings that are configured automatically upon executing `.osx`.\n\n#### MAMP\n\nI use this to develop WordPress websites locally. I use it because I must! It's a pretty elegant solution.\n\n#### Messages\n\nOne of the few native Mac OS apps I use, the Yosemite version is pretty much indispensable. I can send and receive iMessages and SMS messages right from my computer, which is obviously AWESOME because typing on a keyboard is way faster than texting. There is also the ability to integrate other chat services, and I've set up Google Hangouts with mine. Messages and Mailbox have (almost) eliminated the need for me to ever open Gmail in the browser.\n\n#### Slack\n\nSlack is amazing. It's the perfect service to use for a work chatroom. It's even better for developers and designers because it makes file-sharing extremely easy, and it supports Markdown for your code-sharing needs. Plus, it has tons of subtle UI components that make it a delight to use.\n\n#### Mailbox\n\nHaving already been using Mailbox on my iPhone and iPad, I was ecstatic to learn that the beta version for Mac OS was available to download. I love the magic mouse touch integrations, and I also love the keyboard shortcuts. I can respond to emails so much faster, and the design of the app is clean, minimal, and focus-oriented. The only caveat I've seen so far in the desktop app is that the search feature is a little lacking sometimes. That's why I occasionally find myself opening Gmail in a browser to find something that's particularly buried in the archives. That doesn't stop me from using Mailbox. It's still in beta after all.\n\n#### Sunrise\n\nI need Sunrise in my life because the design and UI of Google Calendars is god awful. Sunrise is beautiful and frees up precious tab space in my browser. Enough said.\n\n#### Clear\n\nJust like Mailbox, I had already been using Clear on my iPhone and iPad and loved it to death. The touch gestures make to-do lists fun, and the app translates well on desktop. I use it for my personal task list, since it's not meant to be a solution for project management.\n\n## Background Apps\n\nThese are apps that I rarely ever open (because I don't have to), but I use them daily nonetheless.\n\n#### 1Password\n\nAs a web developer, I have hundreds of login credentials to keep track of (and create) for myself and my clients. 1Password makes it simple to create strong passwords because it takes care of remembering them for you. After you install the app and browser extension, you can use the (brilliant) `cmd+\\` shortcut to instantly log in to any service. You can also store addresses and credit cards to make checkout processes a little easier.\n\nIt's also a safer alternative to browser Autofill or iCloud keychains because all of your credentials are stored in a \"vault\" that requires a master passphrase to unlock. The vault locks automatically after a specified duration of inactive time. In addition, if you're like me and didn't get the app via the Mac App Store, you can sync your vault across all devices using Dropbox, provided you've installed on each device.\n\n#### Dropbox\n\nI use Dropbox because it provides an easy way to sync my 1Password vault, my Sublime preferences, and my Transmit favorites. For all other files I could use an alternative service, but Dropbox wins because it integrates with the essentials. Most of my clients also share files this way.\n\n#### Spectacle\n\nSpectacle was the best free Mac OS window manager I could find. I really enjoy the keyboard shortcuts and the fact that you can customize them. I frequently use `ctrl+option+cmd+→` (or `←`) to move apps between monitors, as well as `ctrl+option+cmd+F` to make windows take up the entire screen without entering full-screen mode.\n\n#### CopyClip\n\nIt's a clipboard manager. Keeps track of things I `cmd+C` from any app, and provides a nice list of my history accessible via the Mac OS toolbar. Need it!\n\n#### Screenmailer\n\nWithout this, I would never be able to teach my clients how to manage their websites. Screenmailer lives in my OSX menu bar, and when I'm ready to record my screen, I click its icon and click \"Record\". When I'm done, I stop the recording, and click a button to copy its newly-generated URL to my clipboard. [Here's a screenmailer video of me writing this post.](https://www.screenmailer.com/v/a4tg7NBsKarkTwY)\n\n---\n\n#### Related Posts\n\n- [A WordPress Development Workflow for Small Teams in 2015](http://zackphilipps.com/a-wordpress-development-workflow-for-small-teams-in-2015/)\n- [A Front End Developer's Sublime Text Setup](http://zackphilipps.com/a-front-end-developers-sublime-text-setup/)\n- [How I Use Chrome to Run a Web Design Business](http://zackphilipps.com/how-i-use-chrome-to-run-a-web-design-business/)","html":"<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-13-at-19-47-11-1.png\" alt=\"Switching Apps\" /></p>\n\n<p>All of the Mac apps I can't develop websites – or live – without.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"chromebeta\">Chrome Beta</h4>\n\n<p>Maybe it's just what I'm used to, but Chrome's developer tools seem unparalleled to me.

If you're an avid [Scratch Theme for WordPress](//scratchtheme.com) user, this post applies to you. If you use WordPress to develop websites, and you're not using Scratch yet, my only question is... why not?!\n\nI just wanted to announce the release of [v1.2](//scratchtheme.com/changelog) and bring some important and awesome features to your attention. So, here goes!\n\n### New Layout Functions\n\nIf you've taken a look at the *advanced* section of the Scratch Docs, you know all about [Layout Functions](http://scratchtheme.com/docs/advanced/#layout-functions). They're great for plugging posts within The Loop into a CSS grid, or plugging sub-fields within an ACF Repeater into a CSS grid. Scratch features 1-6 column Layout Functions, as well as some flexible functions that allow you to completely fill the space in the last row with whatever number of posts or sub-fields is left over. One of the issues with Layout Functions was that sometimes you had to give your posts or sub-fields (let's call the space they take up \"cells\") a `height`. Until now.\n\nWith the new Layout Functions, each row of cells is wrapped in a `div.clearfix`. This means no more unnecessary heights. Everything just works!\n\nIn addition, the means of declaring said layouts is now easier. Don't worry; you can still use the old Layout Functions and they will work well enough. But with the new functions, you don't have to declare `$count` or `$blocks` anymore. Here's an example using an ACF Repeater:\n\n\t<?php\n\t  scratch_layout_declare('repeater', 4);\n\t  while(has_sub_field('repeater')) {\n\t    scratch_layout_start();\n\t?>\n\t  <!-- Content goes here. -->\n\t<?php\n\t\tscratch_layout_end();\n\t  }\n\t?>\n\nThe full function to declare the layout looks like this (parameters below):\n\n\tscratch_layout_declare($args, $columns, $flex = true, $offset = null, $option = null)\n\n#### Parameters\n\n**$args**\n\n* (array) `WP_Query` arguments\n* (string) ACF `$field_name`\n\n**$columns**\n\n* (int) Number of columns to build to (if `4`, `four_columns_flex()` will be used)\n* (string) `custom` (`custom_columns()` will be used)\n\n**$flex**\n\n* (bool) Whether or not to use the layout functions ending in `_flex`\n\n**$offset**\n\n* (string) Offset to use, if any *Only applicable for 2 and 3 column layouts\n  * `1:2`\n  * `2:1`\n  * `1:1:2`\n  * `1:2:1`\n  * `2:1:1`\n\n**$option**\n\n* (mixed) ACF option, if any:\n\n\t\tget_field($field_name, $option)\n\nFeel free to look around [layout-declarations.php](https://github.com/zackphilipps/scratch-theme/blob/master/core/php/layout-declarations.php) if you fancy a more hands-on learning experience.\n\n### ACF Shortcuts\n\nLet's say you wanted to build a button with a href and title set by ACF. This is pretty common. You'd have to type all of this out:\n\n\t<?php if(get_field('link_text')) { ?>\n\t  <p>\n\t    <a class=\"button\"\n\t\t   href=\"<?php the_field('link_href'); ?>\"\n\t\t   title=\"<?php the_field('link_text'); ?>\">\n\t\t  <?php the_field('link_text'); ?>\n\t    </a>\n\t  </p>\n\t<?php } ?>\n\nWhat if you could produce all of this with a one-liner? Well, you can. You could've written this on your own pretty easily. But, if you haven't yet for some reason, Scratch provides this: \n\n\tscratch_button($href, $title, $classes = null, $option = null)\n\nThis is just one of the many ACF Shortcuts now baked into Scratch. For more, visit [acf-shortcuts.php](https://github.com/zackphilipps/scratch-theme/blob/master/core/php/acf-shortcuts.php).\n\n### Layouts Page Template\n\nTo play around with this, create a new page in WordPress and set its template to \"Layouts\". With Scratch, you can now add robust layouts on the fly, including sliders, hero units, staggered columns, and more. In addition, you have full control over [layouts/layout-*.php](https://github.com/zackphilipps/scratch-theme/tree/master/layouts) and [_layouts.scss](https://github.com/zackphilipps/scratch-theme/blob/master/scss/_layouts.scss) for customization.\n\n~~ACF does not currently support editing the field groups themselves, but as per this post, that feature should be in the roadmap.~~\n\n**Update:** Editing the field groups from the Custom Fields screen is now possible through [synchronized JSON](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/synchronized-json/)!\n\n### Conclusion\n\nHopefully some of this got you more excited about working with Scratch and ACF. I know it's definitely saving hours of mine and my coworkers' time building great websites for clients whose demands are steadily growing.\n\n---\n\n#### Related Posts\n\n- [A WordPress Development Workflow for Small Teams in 2015](http://zackphilipps.com/a-wordpress-development-workflow-for-small-teams-in-2015/)","html":"<p>Hello all!

He has been an innovator in a lot of ways. First black president, first president to use the term \"transgender\" in the State of the Union address, first president to make good use of social media... and I'm sure there are more firsts. Honestly, I can't think of another president who has tried as hard to level the playing field for all of us.\n\nAnd just look at that fam! Stunning. But let's talk about the First Lady for a sec. Not only has she somehow become a pop culture icon, but she started the *Let's Move* initiative which has made significant progress in reversing childhood obesity by revamping school lunch menus among other things. And I'm 100% certain that Barack would not advocate for LGBT, women's, or middle-class rights nearly as much as he does without Michelle standing firmly by his side. What an incredible woman.\n\n---\n\n#### Portiellen – pronounced \"por-SHELL-en\"\n\n![Ellen and Portia](/content/images/2015/05/ellen-portia.jpg)\n\nOne of our favorite pastimes is to watch clips of The Ellen Show on YouTube. I'm not entirely sure it's possible to watch her show and stay in a bad mood. The pranks she pulls on celebrities are harmless, fun, and hilarious. Plus, she's always giving away tons of free stuff.\n\nAnother of our favorite pastimes used to be watching *Arrested Development...* and then we ran out of episodes. Portia was fantastic on the show! Ellen would probably tell us to watch *Scandal* now, but we just haven't gotten around to it.\n\nHowever, the really good part is when these two come together. Portia did an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4Sl7L3MzQo) on Ellen's show about [her book](http://www.amazon.com/Unbearable-Lightness-Story-Loss-Gain/dp/1439177791), and they both did an [interview on Oprah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GliztKVS7vY) which was their first as a married couple. Please watch these.\n\nThe first 45 seconds of that first link are so telling... Ellen describes Portia's book as being about Portia's **struggle with self-worth,** and then introduces her. Portia walks out on stage to a cheering crowd and **Bruno Mars's \"Just the Way You Are.\"** They hug each other, and then hold hands and turn to face the crowd. The feels man. The feels.\n\n---\n\n#### Abbilana – Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer\n\n![Abbilana](/content/images/2015/03/twopeasinapod.png)\n\nOkay, so these two aren't romantically involved, but they **are** inseparable.

I love it so much... It has a color scheme built in, and even its own icon set and dock icon, as well as suggested settings and packages! I owe my entire Sublime setup to Jamie Wilson and [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles).\n\n---\n\n### Key Bindings\n\nLike [Matej Latin](https://medium.com/@matejlatin), I had also been using Brackets for a while before I switched to Sublime. I also had a lot of difficulty adjusting to the new keybindings for *Duplicate Line* and *Delete Line*. To emulate this in Sublime, simply navigate to Preferences > Key Bindings – User and add this:\n\n\t[\n    { \"keys\": [\"super+d\"], \"command\": \"duplicate_line\" },\n\t{ \"keys\": [\"super+shift+d\"], \"command\": \"run_macro_file\", \"args\": {\"file\": \"Packages/Default/Delete Line.sublime-macro\"} }\n    ]\n    \nHowever I actually have all of my Sublime preferences synced with my entire development team at work (more on that later – has its pros and cons), and one of them really liked the *Quick Add Next* default behavior of `command+D`, so I got used to this instead:\n\n\t{ \"keys\": [\"super+alt+d\"], \"command\": \"duplicate_line\" }\n    \nTo make that work, I had to go to *System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Launchpad & Dock* and uncheck the box for *Turn Dock Hiding On/Off*.\n\nI'm also a huge fan of [snippets](http://sublimetext.info/docs/en/extensibility/snippets.html), so I wanted a handy shortcut to pop open a list of snippets. This did the trick:\n\n\t{ \"keys\": [\"ctrl+s\"], \"command\": \"show_overlay\", \"args\": {\"overlay\": \"command_palette\", \"text\": \"Snippet: \"}}\n    \nI also have the package [FixMyJS](http://addyosmani.com/blog/fixmyjs/) installed, so the shortcut to use that is:\n\n\t{ \"keys\": [\"alt+super+j\"], \"command\": \"fix\" }\n    \nSo to recap, and for the sake of quick updating in the future, my entire keybindings file looks like this:\n\n\t[\n    { \"keys\": [\"super+shift+d\"], \"command\": \"run_macro_file\", \"args\": {\"file\": \"Packages/Default/Delete Line.sublime-macro\"} },\n    { \"keys\": [\"ctrl+s\"], \"command\": \"show_overlay\", \"args\": {\"overlay\": \"command_palette\", \"text\": \"Snippet: \"}},\n    { \"keys\": [\"alt+super+j\"], \"command\": \"fix\" },\n    { \"keys\": [\"super+alt+d\"], \"command\": \"duplicate_line\" },\n    ]\n\n---\n\n### Preferences\n\nMy preferences are a combination of Mathias's and Jamie's preferences with a few little tweaks of my own. My tweaks are mostly typography-related (I use 14 pt. with a bottom line padding of 4 because I like to be able to see my code), but I also have `find_selected_text` set to `true` (another Brackets-inspo'd behavior). I've also implemented [Ben Frain's top tip to stop hyphens from separating words](http://benfrain.com/top-tips-selection-unrelated-front-end-developer-tips). Here's my entire preferences file:\n\n\t{\n\t\"close_windows_when_empty\": false,\n\t\"color_scheme\": \"Packages/Predawn/predawn.tmTheme\",\n\t\"default_encoding\": \"UTF-8\",\n\t\"default_line_ending\": \"unix\",\n\t\"detect_indentation\": false,\n\t\"draw_indent_guides\": true,\n\t\"draw_minimap_border\": true,\n\t\"draw_white_space\": \"all\",\n\t\"enable_tab_scrolling\": false,\n\t\"ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save\": false,\n\t\"file_exclude_patterns\":\n\t[\n\t\t\".DS_Store\",\n\t\t\"Desktop.ini\",\n\t\t\"*.pyc\",\n\t\t\"._*\",\n\t\t\"Thumbs.db\",\n\t\t\".Spotlight-V100\",\n\t\t\".Trashes\"\n\t],\n\t\"find_selected_text\": true,\n\t\"folder_exclude_patterns\":\n\t[\n\t\t\".git\",\n\t\t\"node_modules\"\n\t],\n\t\"font_size\": 14,\n\t\"highlight_modified_tabs\": true,\n\t\"hot_exit\": false,\n\t\"ignored_packages\":\n\t[\n\t\t\"Vintage\"\n\t],\n\t\"indent_guide_options\":\n\t[\n\t\t\"draw_active\"\n\t],\n\t\"line_padding_bottom\": 4,\n\t\"match_brackets\": true,\n\t\"match_brackets_angle\": true,\n\t\"open_files_in_new_window\": false,\n\t\"overlay_scroll_bars\": \"enabled\",\n\t\"remember_open_files\": false,\n\t\"show_encoding\": true,\n\t\"show_line_endings\": true,\n\t\"sidebar_default\": true,\n\t\"tab_size\": 2,\n\t\"tabs_small\": true,\n\t\"theme\": \"predawn.sublime-theme\",\n\t\"translate_tabs_to_spaces\": false,\n\t\"trim_trailing_white_space_on_save\": true,\n\t\"word_separators\": \"./\\\\()\\\"':,.;<>~!@#$%^&*|+=[]{}`~?\",\n\t\"word_wrap\": true\n\t}\n\n\n---\n\n### Packages\n\n[ACF Snippets](https://github.com/smilledge/acf-sublime-snippets) – For [Advanced Custom Fields for WordPress](http://advancedcustomfields.com). I <3 it. With the baked-in PHP snippet, I can now type `php`, tab, `ifgf`, tab, and then type in the field name as opposed to typing `<?php if(get_field('field_name')): ?>` which is very awkward.\n\n[Color Highlighter](https://github.com/Monnoroch/ColorHighlighter) – Unobtrusively previews hexadecimal color values by underlaying the selected hex codes in different styles.\n\n[Emmet](http://emmet.io/) – Another time-saving package, as now I can type `!`, `tab` as opposed to (along with MANY MANY others):\n\n\t<!DOCTYPE html>\n\t<html lang=\"en\">\n\t<head>\n\t\t<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n\t\t<title>Document</title>\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t\n\t</body>\n\t</html>\n\n[FixMyJS](http://addyosmani.com/blog/fixmyjs/) – Just click the link and read Addy's post.\n\n[GitGutter](https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter) – This is both part of [Mathias's dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) and suggested by Jamie.

I love it so much... It has a color scheme built in, and even its own icon set and dock icon, as well as suggested settings and packages! I owe my entire Sublime setup to Jamie Wilson and <a href=\"https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles\">Mathias Bynens</a>.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"keybindings\">Key Bindings</h3>\n\n<p>Like <a href=\"https://medium.com/@matejlatin\">Matej Latin</a>, I had also been using Brackets for a while before I switched to Sublime. I also had a lot of difficulty adjusting to the new keybindings for <em>Duplicate Line</em> and <em>Delete Line</em>. To emulate this in Sublime, simply navigate to Preferences > Key Bindings – User and add this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[\n{ \"keys\": [\"super+d\"], \"command\": \"duplicate_line\" },\n{ \"keys\": [\"super+shift+d\"], \"command\": \"run_macro_file\", \"args\": {\"file\": \"Packages/Default/Delete Line.sublime-macro\"} }\n]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However I actually have all of my Sublime preferences synced with my entire development team at work (more on that later – has its pros and cons), and one of them really liked the <em>Quick Add Next</em> default behavior of <code>command+D</code>, so I got used to this instead:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{ \"keys\": [\"super+alt+d\"], \"command\": \"duplicate_line\" }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To make that work, I had to go to <em>System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Launchpad &amp; Dock</em> and uncheck the box for <em>Turn Dock Hiding On/Off</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I'm also a huge fan of <a href=\"http://sublimetext.info/docs/en/extensibility/snippets.html\">snippets</a>, so I wanted a handy shortcut to pop open a list of snippets. This did the trick:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{ \"keys\": [\"ctrl+s\"], \"command\": \"show_overlay\", \"args\": {\"overlay\": \"command_palette\", \"text\": \"Snippet: \"}}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I also have the package <a href=\"http://addyosmani.com/blog/fixmyjs/\">FixMyJS</a> installed, so the shortcut to use that is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{ \"keys\": [\"alt+super+j\"], \"command\": \"fix\" }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So to recap, and for the sake of quick updating in the future, my entire keybindings file looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[\n{ \"keys\": [\"super+shift+d\"], \"command\": \"run_macro_file\", \"args\": {\"file\": \"Packages/Default/Delete Line.sublime-macro\"} },\n{ \"keys\": [\"ctrl+s\"], \"command\": \"show_overlay\", \"args\": {\"overlay\": \"command_palette\", \"text\": \"Snippet: \"}},\n{ \"keys\": [\"alt+super+j\"], \"command\": \"fix\" },\n{ \"keys\": [\"super+alt+d\"], \"command\": \"duplicate_line\" },\n]\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"preferences\">Preferences</h3>\n\n<p>My preferences are a combination of Mathias's and Jamie's preferences with a few little tweaks of my own. My tweaks are mostly typography-related (I use 14 pt. with a bottom line padding of 4 because I like to be able to see my code), but I also have <code>find_selected_text</code> set to <code>true</code> (another Brackets-inspo'd behavior). I've also implemented <a href=\"http://benfrain.com/top-tips-selection-unrelated-front-end-developer-tips\">Ben Frain's top tip to stop hyphens from separating words</a>.

I thought it would be fun to write about some of the web apps I use as well as my Chrome extensions.\n\n---\n\n## Web Apps\n\n**Note:** Most of these are freemium, meaning you can enjoy a majority of the features without having to pay a dime.\n\n### Asana\n\nAt [Tribeswell](http://tribeswell.com), we use [Asana](http://asana.com) for **project management.** It does a very good job of staying out of our way and keeping us out of email for internal communications. (Well, Slack helps too.)\n\nWhat I really like about Asana is the keyboard shortcuts for assigning tasks and giving them due dates. It also lets you choose the view of tasks and projects that makes the most sense for you. Another feature I find myself using constantly is [emailing tasks to Asana](https://asana.com/guide/help/email/email-to-asana). Asana will automatically pull all the contents of the email, including attachments, and create a task out of it.\n\n### Toggl\n\nWe use [Toggl](http://toggl.com) for **time tracking.** It's definitely the simplest and best-looking time tracker I've ever seen. We actually use it for logging employees' hours as well as tracking billable hours for clients. Toggl's beautiful report system makes viewing hours over custom date ranges effortless and even fun.\n\nPlus, once you install the [Toggl Button browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/toggl-button/oejgccbfbmkkpaidnkphaiaecficdnfn?hl=en), you get these neat little Toggl buttons all over the place. On a task in Asana, an issue in GitHub, a Google Doc or Sheet, I can simply click \"Start timer\" to start tracking my time.\n\n**Note:** Asana and Toggl are two out of the three [tabs I always have pinned](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/tech-sanity-check/how-to-use-pin-tab-to-organize-your-work-in-google-chrome/).\n\n### Nusii\n\n![Nusii Dashboard](/content/images/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-03-at-21-23-53.png)\n\nI use [Nusii](http://nusii.com/#_l_1c) for **proposals.** It lets me use templates, and gets even more modular than that by allowing me to create and save reusable sections. The sections can be either text-based or price-based. Nusii is designed so that I can offer my clients tiered pricing options. I can include fixed prices or prices per hour, day, or month. They've also recently added a digital signing feature which is pretty awesome.\n\nWhen I'm done writing a proposal – thanks to Nusii it now takes WAY less time – I can send it to the client straight from the app and get a notification email whenever the client views it. The client can then choose (a) pricing option(s) and accept the proposal right in the browser. Don't worry, there's the option to download and print a PDF version if the client so desires. Oh, and both the PDF and the web-based version are **drop dead gorgeous.**\n\nOther features include custom branding and color scheme and a custom URL that all of your proposals can be accessed from (ours is **proposals.tribeswell.com**).\n\n### Kashoo\n\nWe use [Kashoo](http://kashoo.com) for **cloud accounting.** It handles all of our invoices from creation to sendoff to clearance. It also features a very robust reporting system so we can compare profit & loss using custom date ranges. Another thing we constantly do is glance at all of our aging receivables to see which clients have invoices that are still out and how long they've been out.\n\n### Calendly\n\n![Calendly User Interface](/content/images/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-03-at-21-26-07.png)\n\nI use [Calendly](http://calendly.com) (shoutout to [Marcus Blankenship](http://www.marcusblankenship.com/)) for **scheduling appointments.** People who want to meet with me can use my personal link and schedule appointments themselves. This eliminates about ten emails & phone calls back and forth trying to figure out a day and time that works.\n\n### Buffer\n\nTribeswell isn't much into the **social media** game at the moment, but when we are, [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) is nice because it allows managing our Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter accounts from a central location. It also takes care of evenly scheduling posts and automatically... posting... them which is great for us and our followers.\n\n### Strictly Dev\n\nI'll talk about these more in-depth [in another post](http://zackphilipps.com/a-wordpress-development-workflow-for-small-teams-in-2015/), but for now:\n\n * GitHub\n * Bitbucket\n * DigitalOcean\n * Codeship\n * Stack Overflow\n * New Relic\n\n### Etc.\n\nSince everyone should be using these, here are some that don't deserve their own sections but rather honorable mentions:\n\n * All things Google\n * My social media inlets of choice: Tumblr, Twitter\n\n---\n\n## Extensions\n\n### Shipscope\n\nShipscope is [CodeShip's browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shipscope/jdedmgopefelimgjceagffkeeiknclhh?hl=en) that shows me a list of all of my projects and their build statuses. I opted out of email or Slack notifications for my builds and decided to use this instead.\n\n### Font Face Ninja\n\n[Font Face Ninja](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fontface-ninja/eljapbgkmlngdpckoiiibecpemleclhh?hl=en-US) lets me spy on the typography of a web page without having to open up DevTools. Plus, it just looks nice and is fun to use. Who doesn't want a little ninja icon always visible in the top-right corner of their browser window?\n\n**Disclaimer:** this extension will break a site on very rare occurances.\n\n### Adblock Plus\n\nIf you don't have this, what's wrong with you? [Get it, now!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb?hl=en-US)\n\n### GhostText\n\nMy coworker recently alerted me to the existence of this gem. It allows me to press `cmd+shift+K` to instantly start using [Sublime Text](http://zackphilipps.com/a-front-end-developers-sublime-text-setup/) instead of whatever shitty `textarea` I am currently using to code in (read: WordPress). You just have to have the [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ghosttext-for-chrome/godiecgffnchndlihlpaajjcplehddca?hl=en) and the [package](https://github.com/Cacodaimon/GhostText-for-SublimeText) installed.\n\n### Minimal New Tab Clock\n\n![Minimal New Tab Clock](/content/images/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-03-at-21-27-02.png)\n\nThere are tons of [\"New Tab\" extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/new%20tab?hl=en&_category=extensions). I picked [this one](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minimal-new-tab-clock/impmanfocmgfodfbnhbmkkonnpcogfak?hl=en) because the analog, minimal look actually calms me down.\n\n**Update:** I am now using [Embark](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/embark-new-tab-page/aeajehgeohhgjbhhbicilpenjfcbfnpg?hl=en).\n\n### Terms of Service; Didn’t Read\n\n[I simply find this interesting.](https://tosdr.org/)\n\n---\n\n#### Related Posts\n\n- [A Front End Developer’s Daily App Stack](http://zackphilipps.com/a-front-end-developers-daily-app-stack/)\n- [A Front End Developer's Sublime Text Setup](http://zackphilipps.com/a-front-end-developers-sublime-text-setup/)\n- [A WordPress Development Workflow for Small Teams in 2015](http://zackphilipps.com/a-wordpress-development-workflow-for-small-teams-in-2015/)","html":"<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/04/google-chrome-2.jpg\" alt=\"How I Use Chrome to Run a Web Design Business\" /></p>\n\n<p>As previously mentioned in <a href=\"http://zackphilipps.com/a-front-end-developers-daily-app-stack/\">A Front End Developer’s Daily App Stack</a>, I use Chrome Beta even though I'd like to use Safari on Yosemite because I strongly prefer Chrome's DevTools.

I thought I would share my small amount of insight. Full disclaimer – this is for developers.\n\nOften times, when searching for a fix online, we race through results and may miss the answer we were looking for several times before we finally see it. No doubt there are several blog posts just like this all over the web, but I don't think adding mine to the mix will hurt. It should hopefully increase your chances of finding your answer faster!\n\n### Step 1 – Do not panic!\n\nFirst make sure that the site is actually down. Sometimes sites will become briefly unavailable and then bounce back within seconds.\n\n### Step 2 – Figure out where your website is hosted.\n\nWhere the site is hosted will affect the process needed to fix the issue.\n\n### Step 3 – Double check the error message if there is one, and determine your next step.\n\n- Does it say “Briefly unavailable for scheduled maintenance”? If so, WordPress core or one or more WordPress plugins are updating. If this message does not disappear (and the site return to normal) within 2 minutes, something else may be wrong.\n- Does it say “Error establishing a database connection”? This could mean one of several things.\n  - The `wp-config.php` file is messed up. Either the database name, database user, database password, or database host information is incorrect. All 4 pieces could be wrong. This usually only happens when sites are being set up or moved around.\n  - Either the web server’s OR the data server’s `mysql` service could have stopped. You can check the status of `mysql` by running the `sudo service mysql status` command. If it has stopped, simply run `sudo service mysql start` or `sudo service mysql restart`.\n  - If the site uses a remote database connection, the data server could be down (not likely if the data server is only used for data). Check the database host information in `wp-config.php`. If it says anything other than `localhost`, the database is being hosted remotely.\n  - If the site uses a remote database connection, the server could have closed off remote communications temporarily due to an attack (also not likely). If this is the case, a reboot may be necessary. If you cannot perform the reboot safely yourself, call your hosting provider's support line.\n  - If the site is on a reseller account, there is a high chance that the resources allocated to that particular client have been exceeded. These issues usually resolve themselves pretty quickly, but if the error is repeatedly occurring, you may need to boost that client’s hosting package. If you’ve never done this before, call your hosting provider's support line and ask them to check it out/walk you through the issue. Make sure you secure any appropriate login credentials you may need before making the call.\n- Does it say “504 Bad Gateway”? This is usually a configuration issue. There’s not much you can do besides reconfigure (re-start the whole setup from scratch) or call your hosting provider's support line and ask them to check it out/walk you through the issue. Make sure you secure any appropriate login credentials you may need before making the call.\n- Does it say something along the lines of “The server stopped responding”? First double-check your internet connection. If Google and Facebook work, then the server itself may be down. You can confirm this by visiting the primary domains of the server itself (ex: myserver.tribeswell.com). If the server is down, a reboot may be necessary. If you cannot perform the reboot safely yourself, call your hosting provider's support line.\n- Does it say “500 Internal Server Error”, \"403 Forbidden\", or \"401 Unauthorized\", or something else about browsing not being permitted? This is almost always a file ownership/permissions issue and usually only occurs during setup or site migration. You need to reconfigure or contact your hosting provider to figure out the permissions issue.\n- Most other error messages are likely PHP syntax errors. This means you or someone else wrote bad code and it needs to be fixed. The error message should point you to the exact file and line of code that caused the error.\n \n### Step 4 – If there is no error message, what’s wrong?\n\n- Does the site just pull up a blank white screen? This is likely due to a PHP syntax error. The error would have to occur early on in the code’s execution to prevent the rest of the page from loading, like in `functions.php` or `header.php`.\n  - **Tip:** try renaming the `plugins` directory to `_plugins` to see if the issue is with a plugin, or renaming the `themes` directory to `_themes` to see if the issue is with  the theme.\n- Are elements on the page behaving weirdly? Open up Dev Tools and check the JavaScript Console. If there are JS errors, it could be a JS issue. If not, it’s a CSS issue.\nIs something just broken and you can’t explain it? Probably a PHP syntax error. Try this to get an error message displayed:\n\nReplace `define( 'WP_DEBUG', false );` in `wp-config.php` with:\n\n\terror_reporting(E_ALL);\n\tini_set('display_errors', 1);\n\tdefine( 'WP_DEBUG', true );","html":"<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-22-at-21-24-09-1.png\" alt=\"This webpage is not available\" /></p>\n\n<p>Recently I was tasked with drafting a simple document explaining to coworkers what to do if a website is misbehaving.

This is the kind of craving that only happens once in a while, but when it does, it's **strong...** and cannot be satisfied by any other food or food provider.\n\nRight now you're probably thinking, \"Great customer service? At a McDonald's?\" Just... please be patient and keep reading.\n\nThe older I get, the worse my memory gets, and so I cannot recall what entrees we ordered, but here's what I do remember: They forgot the fries. Now, when we order McDonald's, we do what any self-respecting McDonald's eater does. We eat the fries in the car on the way to our destination. Who has time to wait for fries? The hotter they are, the better. It's like the wounds that are opened up by the napalm-like frying oil on the roof of your mouth allow you to take in even more delicious salty McPotato flavor.\n\nSo, needless to say, we turned that car around real quick. Now, here's what I'm talking about. As soon as I walked in the door, receipt in hand, the guy in charge was like \"You back for your fries?\" I'm saying, \"Yes,\" and thinking, \"YAAAAAAAAS bless you holy man for taking the pressure off of me to explain myself. Now I have to interact with you less, which makes me like you more.\"\n\nHe's already standing by the fryers, waiting on the fries to finish. To fill the silence, he says, \"You about to get some GOOD ones, too. These'll be HOT and FRESH.\" While giggling like a little kid, I say \"Awesome,\" but I'm thinking, \"YAAAAAAAS!\"\n\nSo to recap, as soon as I walked in the door, he made me appreciative. Now he's got me laughing and feeling all warm and fuzzy inside.\n\nHe scoops up the fries, overfills two large cups (I'm pretty sure we ordered mediums), puts them in a bag, grabs about 50 napkins, and puts them in the bag as well. He walks over to the counter, and I'm thinking this is it. I'm satisfied. But it doesn't end there!\n\nHe pulls out some coupons that look like business cards, and starts thumbing through them. He says, \"Now, for our mistake, I'mma give you a little something special on us. You like muffins?\" I shrug and say, \"Yeah!\" He hands me a coupon for a free muffin. He then says, \"You got a girlfriend or somethin'?\" I nod. \"Here's one for her too.\" I say, \"Thanks, man. I really appreciate that.\" He says, \"You have a great day, now.\" I say, \"You, too,\" and walk out of there beaming.\n\nAnd THAT, folks, is what great customer service is made of. Notice that he exceeded my expectations so much, he didn't even have to say sorry!\n\n---\n\nI felt like writing about this, because I know food service and retail jobs suck. I worked at a Steak 'n Shake for two years. I was a manager for 8 of those 24 months. The corporate heirarchy makes unreasonable demands, a lot of employees aren't helpful because they don't get paid enough to care, and a lot of customers just don't get it and are thusly rude. Plus the work itself is monotonous and tedious at best, completely physically and mentally overwhelming at worst. And I'm a white male! I can't imagine adding harassment to that shitstorm.\n\nAnyway, I just feel like no matter how shitty my day was, I was always, at a bare minimum, polite to customers. After all, as an employee, you have no idea how shitty your customer's day is. I guess the overall lesson here is, treat others the way you would like to be treated.

I'm talking about front end tools that speed up workflow like Grunt and Sass. The developers that work on WordPress core know that, and they are utilizing it. WordPress theme developers even utilize it. Maybe even plugin developers. So why can't we utilize it on a per-project basis when developing WordPress websites?\n\nWe **can.** We **can** develop every WordPress site locally. We **can** use Grunt, Sass, and NPM on every single project. If we must, we **can** even share our local sites with the outside world for previewing or collaborating.\n\nWe **don't** have to install a different WordPress plugin for each front end tool we want to use. We **don't** have to do all of our development work on remote servers. Even though that may seem easier or faster, it's not ideal. You need to have a way to stage a bunch of work without affecting what's already there.\n\nA WordPress fundamental that really complicates things is this: **the codebase and the database are completely separate from each other.** So we need an easy way to migrate the site's code from local to development server and back, to production server. We also need a separate way to do this with the database.\n\nHere's a list of the tools that are instrumental in making this happen:\n\n- [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/)\n- [Scratch](http://scratchtheme.com)\n- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)\n- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)\n- [Codeship](https://codeship.com)\n- [WP Sync DB](https://github.com/wp-sync-db/wp-sync-db)\n\nBelow, I'll explain these tools in a bit more detail. After that, I'll explain how to use them. You might want to get in the tutorial-following mood to continue reading, but following along isn't required for learning. And you can certainly use different tools.\n\n---\n\n#### MAMP\n\n[MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) stands for Mac, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. It's what we use to develop WordPress sites locally. You have to have it or something comparable. I like MAMP PRO because it's so easy to use and has a nice design.\n\n#### Scratch\n\n[Scratch](http://scratchtheme.com) is the world's first [Advanced Custom Fields](http://advancedcustomfields.com/)-ready WordPress theme. It's not so much a theme as a springboard for building your own fully custom WordPress themes.\n\nScratch has its own Gruntfile that takes care of SCSS and JS compilation, concatenation, and minification. It also optimizes images as they are uploaded to the WordPress media library. It uses BrowserSync for live reloading and synchronized cross-browser/cross-device testing.\n\n#### Bitbucket\n\n[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) provides Git and Mercurial code management for teams. It has a bit more of a flexible pricing plan with regard to private repositories. You could easily use an organization plan with GitHub.\n\n#### DigitalOcean\n\n[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) provides simple cloud hosting for developers. We <3 it because we have 100% control of all of our servers (or \"Droplets\", as DO labels them). DO has a gorgeous web app for managing all of the droplets in the browser, but to be honest, if you go with DO you'll be doing most of your work in the terminal. I will talk about our droplet setup in another post, but it's nothing you can't find while browsing DO's invaluable tutorials and forums.\n\n#### Codeship\n\n[Codeship](https://codeship.com) is a continuous delivery platform. What that means is you can configure automated testing and deployment to be run on every push you make to your repository. It's pretty sick. I'll explain further on in the post. There are loads of CI and CD platforms out there, but we felt this one was the most small-team-friendly due to its ease of use and pricing structure.\n\n#### WP Sync DB\n\n[WP Sync DB](https://github.com/wp-sync-db/wp-sync-db) is a WordPress plugin that allows you to pull and push your databases with automatic find and replace for URLs, all at the click of a button or two.\n\n---\n\n## The Process – Setup, Pushing, and Pulling\n\n![Buzz Lightyear everywhere meme](/content/images/2015/07/buzzlightyeareverywhere.png)\n\n#### Local Setup\n\n1. Install MAMP or MAMP Pro.\n1. Install WordPress.\n1. [Follow the steps to get Scratch up and running.](http://scratchtheme.com/docs/getting-started/)\n1. Push the final codebase to a new Bitbucket repo.\n\nObviously, you won't have to install MAMP every time you want to work on a new WordPress site, but you will have to install WordPress and Scratch for each project, so you'll want to streamline this as much as possible. Our approach was to install everything just the way we always want it, and then create a Bitbucket repository containing that code and an SQL dump of the database. We call it \"Perfect Setup.\" Then, when it's time to start a new project, we simply clone Perfect Setup and push it to a brand new Bitbucket repo.\n\nBut, I decided to take it one step further. It's kind of pain having to set up a new DB and DB user everytime, and then going through the WP install process, linking up the `wp-config.php` file. So I created `perfect_setup.sh`. [You can view the GitHub repo here.](https://github.com/zackphilipps/new-wp-mamp-shell) It shaves minutes off of setup time, and these minutes add up.\n\nI would also share Perfect Setup with you here, but we use two premium plugins ([Advanced Custom Fields Pro](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) and [Gravity Forms](http://www.gravityforms.com/), which are well worth it), so we have to keep it private. Plus, your perfect setup may not be Perfect Setup. I encourage you to make your own!\n\n#### Remote Setup\n\n1. Set up a dev server by adding a Droplet in DigitalOcean.\n1. Reserve a directory on your dev server for the site.\n1. Configure DNS for the dev site.\n1. Clone your new Bitbucket repo to the reserved directory.\n1. Push your local database using WP Sync DB.\n1. Integrate your Bitbucket repo and remote server with Codeship.\n\nFor our LEMP stack and for reserving directories, we use a CLI called [EasyEngine](https://rtcamp.com/easyengine/). You simply run `sudo ee site create example.com --wpfc`, and it creates the site directory, creates the Nginx configuration file, and creates the symbolic link to the newly created directory. It also creates the WordPress database, installs WordPress, and generates the `wp-config.php` file. Sorta like `perfect_setup.sh` (you can see where I got the inspiration).\n\nOnce you've got the directory reserved, you can clone your project to said directory. You'll want to clone using SSH so that your Codeship deployments work. [Here's a guide for getting Bitbucket/SSH set up on your server.](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-ssh-for-git-728138079.html) Once you've done that, you can do something like this:\n\n```\ncd /var/www/example.com/htdocs\nsudo rm -rf *\ngit clone git@bitbucket.org:example-user/example-site.git .\n```\n\n> **Don't run `sudo rm -rf *` unless you know what you're doing. That command removes everything in the current working directory, recursively, with no way to get it back.**\n\nHere's where WP Sync DB comes in. You need to get the new local database you just set up linked with the remote site. Right now, if you've configured your DNS, when you visit your dev site you will see a blank white screen. This is because the active database is searching for Twentyfifteen, the current default WordPress theme. However, you have Scratch installed. (You may actually see Twentyfifteen depending on whether or not you left the theme directory in your WordPress installation.)\n\nEven though you have a blank white screen on the front end, you can still log in to WordPress. You need to activate the WP Sync DB plugin to use it. Then, you must go to *Tools > Migrate DB > Settings*. Check the boxes to allow both push and pull requests, and then copy the connection info.\n\n![Settings for WP Sync DB](/content/images/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-28-21-56-58-copy.png)\n\nBack on your local machine, go to *Tools > Migrate DB*, and click Push. Paste the connection info you copied from the dev site. I usually check \"Backup the remote database before replacing it\" and \"Save Migration Profile\", adding the word \"PUSH\" or \"PULL\" to the end of the profile name depending on what I'm doing. This allows me to push the database next time with 2 clicks, and if I add a pull profile from the dev site, the names of the profiles won't be the same and confuse me.\n\n![Push Settings for WP Sync DB](/content/images/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-28-22-05-00.png)\n\nNow, assuming you've configured your DNS correctly, when you navigate to your dev site you will see your perfect setup in all its glory! Well, just as it is on your local machine I hope.\n\nIt's time to add our project to Codeship. Simply add your Bitbucket repo and skip the test configuration for now.\n\n![Codeship screenshot](/content/images/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-28-22-14-39.png)\n\n> **Note:** We never use automated testing for WordPress websites. It's a little bit overkill. WordPress core and plugin developers are already doing this. I do use it for Scratch and Perfect Setup, though. Just to test the gruntfiles.\n\nTo configure your deployment pipeline, go to *Project Settings > Deployment.* Add a pipeline for the `master` branch. You'll notice there are a few third-party integrations to take advantage of, like Amazon S3 and Heroku. We're using DigitalOcean, so we need to choose *Custom Script.*\n    \n![Codeship deployment screenshot](/content/images/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-28-22-19-38.png)\n\nThe script you use for this depends entirely on your dev server's configuration, but ours looks something like this:\n\n    ssh user@example.com 'cd /var/www/example.com/htdocs && sudo git add . --ignore-removal && sudo git stash && sudo git pull origin master'\n    \nFirst, we SSH in to our server as `user`.\n\n> It would probably be a great idea to add a user just for Codeship. You could call it... `codeship`? Run `sudo adduser codeship` on your dev server and store the password you assign it somewhere.\n\nThen, we navigate to the directory where our project has been cloned. Lastly, we add all untracked files, stash any changes that have occurred on the dev site, and pull in any changes from the `master` branch of the `origin` remote. If you're assuming that any differences between the dev site and the repo will be overwritten by the repo, you are absolutely correct. If you want to keep any of those differences, it's important to **first manually commit them on the dev server and push them to your repo, and then pull them down to your local machine.**\n\nOnce you save this deployment pipeline, your custom script will be run on the next successful `git push origin master`. This is why it's important to use the SSH version of the `origin` remote (you can test your remotes by running `git remote -v`), because since your script is run automatically, you can't enter a password unless you store it in plain text on Codeship. With SSH, Bitbucket uses the SSH keys you set up to authenticate the `git pull`.\n\nThere are a couple of other things you need to do to ensure your deployment runs successfully. You need to add the Codeship public SSH key, which is set on a per-project basis, to `codeship`'s `authorized_keys` file, located at `/home/codeship/.ssh/authorized_keys`. The key is found in *Project Settings > General > SSH public key.*\n\nLastly, you need to make sure `codeship` is a member of the group `sudo`:\n\n    sudo usermod -a -G sudo codeship\n\nand that it can run `git` commands using `sudo` without having to enter a password. To do this, run `sudo visudo` from your dev server and find this line:\n\n    # Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n    %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n    \nand change it to this:\n\n\t# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n    %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL, NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/git\n    \n> **Note:** `/usr/bin/git` may differ for you. Run `which git` to find out where your `git` command lives.\n\nNow, you should test your deployment! I always like to add the Codeship status badge to my project's `README.md`. It looks like this:\n\n\t[ ![Codeship Status for user/example](https://codeship.com/projects/<PROJECT_UUID>/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/<PROJECT_ID>)\n    \nand is found in *Project Settings > Notification > Status Images > Copy Markdown Syntax.*\n\n#### Work Work Work\n\nFor now, you're done configuring and you're free to work on your project in peace. Enjoy hassle-free deployment of both the codebase AND the database!\n\nYou'll want to watch out for permissions on your dev server, as they'll be overwritten every time your deployment is run. We use a [snippet](http://sublimetext.info/docs/en/extensibility/snippets.html) in Sublime called `permissions` that looks something like this:\n\n    find * -type d -print0 | sudo xargs -0 chmod 0755 && find * -type f -print0 | sudo xargs -0 chmod 0644 && sudo chown -R www-data:www-data *\n    \nto quickly fix ownership and permissions on a per-site basis. You run this from the individual site's root directory on the server. You could also add this to your deployment script, but that would require giving the `codeship` user privileges to use `sudo` on **any** command without being prompted for a password.\n\n#### Production Deployment\n\nWhen you're all set to move to production, you'll want to follow the same Remote Setup process that you did for development. Then, simply add another deployment in Codeship. We use the `production` branch for production deployment. Then, on our local machines, we switch to the `production` branch, make sure it contains the same code as `master`, and run `git push origin production`.\n\nFinally, you just have to add another migration profile using WP Sync DB called `productionsite.com PUSH`. Then push! From now on, both your dev and prod deployments will be easy as pie.\n\n---\n\n#### Pro Git Tips\n\nIf you don't have a `.gitignore` file in your perfect setup, you definitely want one. You want to at the very least ignore the `wp-config.php` file and all `node_modules`. The `wp-config.php` file will be inherently different on each server, so there's no reason to have it in the repo, and NPM modules have so many nested directories and files that they can cause problems on remote servers (which I have experienced first-hand). Besides, you're only going to be running Grunt when you're developing locally, so there's no reason to ever have them in a remote environment.\n\nHere's our `.gitignore` in its entirety:\n\n```\n# Include your project-specific ignores in this file\n# Read about how to use .gitignore: https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files\n\n# Compiled source #\n###################\n*.com\n*.class\n*.dll\n*.exe\n*.o\n*.so\n\n# Packages #\n############\n# it's better to unpack these files and commit the raw source\n# git has its own built in compression methods\n*.7z\n*.dmg\n*.gz\n*.iso\n*.jar\n*.rar\n*.tar\n*.zip\n\n# Logs and databases #\n######################\n*.log\n\n# OS generated files #\n######################\n.DS_Store\n.DS_Store?\n._*\n.Spotlight-V100\n.Trashes\nehthumbs.db\nThumbs.db\n\n# Gruntfile, gulpfile, Sass cache and node modules #\n##########################################\nGruntfile.js\ngulpfile.js\n.sass-cache/\nnode_modules/\n\n# Backups and Uploads #\n#######################\nwp-content/backup*/\nwp-content/uploads\n\n# W3 Total Cache #\n##################\nwp-content/cache/\nwp-content/w3tc-config/*\n!wp-content/w3tc-config/master.php\n\n# Ignore all WP themes except Scratch #\n#######################################\nwp-content/themes/*\n!wp-content/themes/scratch-theme\n\n# WP Config #\n#############\nwp-config.php\n\n# iThemes #\n###########\nnginx.conf\n\n# InfiniteWP #\n##############\nwp-content/infinitewp\n```\n    \nIn your remote environments, you will want to set some sensible `git` defaults for each project, like so:\n\n    # Suppress long filename warnings/errors\n    sudo git config --system core.longpaths true\n\n    # Tell git to ignore changes in file ownership/permissions\n    sudo git config core.fileMode false\n\n    # Display the status in a pager so you can see the whole thing\n    sudo git config --global pager.status true\n\n    # Suppress moar warnings\n    sudo git config core.safecrlf false\n    \nWe also have a Sublime snippet for this, called `gitconfig`, that expands to this:\n\n    sudo git config --system core.longpaths true && sudo git config core.fileMode false && sudo git config --global pager.status true && sudo git config core.safecrlf false\n    \n#### Restricting Access to Dev Sites\n\nYou may not want your dev sites to be accessible to just anyone. There's only one way to 100% keep your site off of search engines, and that's to make sure your site pulls up a login form no matter where the user lands.\n\nAccomplishing this with WordPress is super easy. First, you'll want to make sure the WordPress function `auth_redirect()` works on the front end of your site. It only works on the back end by default. Add this to your `functions.php` file:\n\n    /* MAKE AUTH_REDIRECT WORK ON FRONT END */\n    add_filter( 'auth_redirect_scheme', 'wpse16975_check_loggedin' );\n    function wpse16975_check_loggedin() {\n        return 'logged_in';\n    }\n    \nNow, you can add `<?php auth_redirect(); ?>` to `header.php`. But only on the dev site! And be sure to commit your changes so they aren't overwritten on the next deploy.\n\n**UPDATE:** You should also tell Git to ignore the `uploads` directory. Especially if your site is going to have a lot of them. If you bloat your repo too much Github and Bitbucket start restricting your access to it. Plus, it's just good practice to consider media as part of the site content/database. WP Sync DB has a [Media Files add-on](https://github.com/wp-sync-db/wp-sync-db-media-files) for transferring uploads to and from environments.\n\n---\n\n#### Related Posts\n\n- [A Front End Developer’s Daily App Stack](http://zackphilipps.com/a-front-end-developers-daily-app-stack/)\n- [A Front End Developer's Sublime Text Setup](http://zackphilipps.com/a-front-end-developers-sublime-text-setup/)\n- [How I Use Chrome to Run a Web Design Business](http://zackphilipps.com/how-i-use-chrome-to-run-a-web-design-business/)","html":"<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/07/19.jpg\" alt=\"Coding and such with big monitors\" /></p>\n\n<p>The future of web development is here, and has been for a while.

Check the boxes to allow both push and pull requests, and then copy the connection info.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-28-21-56-58-copy.png\" alt=\"Settings for WP Sync DB\" /></p>\n\n<p>Back on your local machine, go to <em>Tools > Migrate DB</em>, and click Push. Paste the connection info you copied from the dev site. I usually check \"Backup the remote database before replacing it\" and \"Save Migration Profile\", adding the word \"PUSH\" or \"PULL\" to the end of the profile name depending on what I'm doing. This allows me to push the database next time with 2 clicks, and if I add a pull profile from the dev site, the names of the profiles won't be the same and confuse me.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-28-22-05-00.png\" alt=\"Push Settings for WP Sync DB\" /></p>\n\n<p>Now, assuming you've configured your DNS correctly, when you navigate to your dev site you will see your perfect setup in all its glory! Well, just as it is on your local machine I hope.</p>\n\n<p>It's time to add our project to Codeship. Simply add your Bitbucket repo and skip the test configuration for now.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-28-22-14-39.png\" alt=\"Codeship screenshot\" /></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Note:</strong> We never use automated testing for WordPress websites. It's a little bit overkill. WordPress core and plugin developers are already doing this. I do use it for Scratch and Perfect Setup, though. Just to test the gruntfiles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To configure your deployment pipeline, go to <em>Project Settings > Deployment.</em> Add a pipeline for the <code>master</code> branch. You'll notice there are a few third-party integrations to take advantage of, like Amazon S3 and Heroku. We're using DigitalOcean, so we need to choose <em>Custom Script.</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-28-22-19-38.png\" alt=\"Codeship deployment screenshot\" /></p>\n\n<p>The script you use for this depends entirely on your dev server's configuration, but ours looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ssh user@example.com 'cd /var/www/example.com/htdocs &amp;&amp; sudo git add . --ignore-removal &amp;&amp; sudo git stash &amp;&amp; sudo git pull origin master'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>First, we SSH in to our server as <code>user</code>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It would probably be a great idea to add a user just for Codeship. You could call it... <code>codeship</code>? Run <code>sudo adduser codeship</code> on your dev server and store the password you assign it somewhere.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then, we navigate to the directory where our project has been cloned. Lastly, we add all untracked files, stash any changes that have occurred on the dev site, and pull in any changes from the <code>master</code> branch of the <code>origin</code> remote. If you're assuming that any differences between the dev site and the repo will be overwritten by the repo, you are absolutely correct. If you want to keep any of those differences, it's important to <strong>first manually commit them on the dev server and push them to your repo, and then pull them down to your local machine.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Once you save this deployment pipeline, your custom script will be run on the next successful <code>git push origin master</code>. This is why it's important to use the SSH version of the <code>origin</code> remote (you can test your remotes by running <code>git remote -v</code>), because since your script is run automatically, you can't enter a password unless you store it in plain text on Codeship. With SSH, Bitbucket uses the SSH keys you set up to authenticate the <code>git pull</code>.</p>\n\n<p>There are a couple of other things you need to do to ensure your deployment runs successfully. You need to add the Codeship public SSH key, which is set on a per-project basis, to <code>codeship</code>'s <code>authorized_keys</code> file, located at <code>/home/codeship/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>. The key is found in <em>Project Settings > General > SSH public key.</em></p>\n\n<p>Lastly, you need to make sure <code>codeship</code> is a member of the group <code>sudo</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo usermod -a -G sudo codeship\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and that it can run <code>git</code> commands using <code>sudo</code> without having to enter a password. To do this, run <code>sudo visudo</code> from your dev server and find this line:</p>\n\n<pre><code># Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and change it to this:</p>\n\n<pre><code># Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL, NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/git\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Note:</strong> <code>/usr/bin/git</code> may differ for you. Run <code>which git</code> to find out where your <code>git</code> command lives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, you should test your deployment! I always like to add the Codeship status badge to my project's <code>README.md</code>. It looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[ ![Codeship Status for user/example](https://codeship.com/projects/&lt;PROJECT_UUID&gt;/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/&lt;PROJECT_ID&gt;)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and is found in <em>Project Settings > Notification > Status Images > Copy Markdown Syntax.</em></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"workworkwork\">Work Work Work</h4>\n\n<p>For now, you're done configuring and you're free to work on your project in peace. Enjoy hassle-free deployment of both the codebase AND the database!</p>\n\n<p>You'll want to watch out for permissions on your dev server, as they'll be overwritten every time your deployment is run. We use a <a href=\"http://sublimetext.info/docs/en/extensibility/snippets.html\">snippet</a> in Sublime called <code>permissions</code> that looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>find * -type d -print0 | sudo xargs -0 chmod 0755 &amp;&amp; find * -type f -print0 | sudo xargs -0 chmod 0644 &amp;&amp; sudo chown -R www-data:www-data *\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to quickly fix ownership and permissions on a per-site basis. You run this from the individual site's root directory on the server. You could also add this to your deployment script, but that would require giving the <code>codeship</code> user privileges to use <code>sudo</code> on <strong>any</strong> command without being prompted for a password.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"productiondeployment\">Production Deployment</h4>\n\n<p>When you're all set to move to production, you'll want to follow the same Remote Setup process that you did for development. Then, simply add another deployment in Codeship. We use the <code>production</code> branch for production deployment. Then, on our local machines, we switch to the <code>production</code> branch, make sure it contains the same code as <code>master</code>, and run <code>git push origin production</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, you just have to add another migration profile using WP Sync DB called <code>productionsite.com PUSH</code>. Then push! From now on, both your dev and prod deployments will be easy as pie.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4 id=\"progittips\">Pro Git Tips</h4>\n\n<p>If you don't have a <code>.gitignore</code> file in your perfect setup, you definitely want one. You want to at the very least ignore the <code>wp-config.php</code> file and all <code>node_modules</code>. The <code>wp-config.php</code> file will be inherently different on each server, so there's no reason to have it in the repo, and NPM modules have so many nested directories and files that they can cause problems on remote servers (which I have experienced first-hand). Besides, you're only going to be running Grunt when you're developing locally, so there's no reason to ever have them in a remote environment.</p>\n\n<p>Here's our <code>.gitignore</code> in its entirety:</p>\n\n<pre><code># Include your project-specific ignores in this file\n# Read about how to use .gitignore: https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files\n\n# Compiled source #\n###################\n*.com\n*.class\n*.dll\n*.exe\n*.o\n*.so\n\n# Packages #\n############\n# it's better to unpack these files and commit the raw source\n# git has its own built in compression methods\n*.7z\n*.dmg\n*.gz\n*.iso\n*.jar\n*.rar\n*.tar\n*.zip\n\n# Logs and databases #\n######################\n*.log\n\n# OS generated files #\n######################\n.DS_Store\n.DS_Store?\n._*\n.Spotlight-V100\n.Trashes\nehthumbs.db  \nThumbs.db\n\n# Gruntfile, gulpfile, Sass cache and node modules #\n##########################################\nGruntfile.js  \ngulpfile.js  \n.sass-cache/\nnode_modules/\n\n# Backups and Uploads #\n#######################\nwp-content/backup*/  \nwp-content/uploads\n\n# W3 Total Cache #\n##################\nwp-content/cache/  \nwp-content/w3tc-config/*  \n!wp-content/w3tc-config/master.php\n\n# Ignore all WP themes except Scratch #\n#######################################\nwp-content/themes/*  \n!wp-content/themes/scratch-theme\n\n# WP Config #\n#############\nwp-config.php\n\n# iThemes #\n###########\nnginx.conf\n\n# InfiniteWP #\n##############\nwp-content/infinitewp  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In your remote environments, you will want to set some sensible <code>git</code> defaults for each project, like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code># Suppress long filename warnings/errors\nsudo git config --system core.longpaths true\n\n# Tell git to ignore changes in file ownership/permissions\nsudo git config core.fileMode false\n\n# Display the status in a pager so you can see the whole thing\nsudo git config --global pager.status true\n\n# Suppress moar warnings\nsudo git config core.safecrlf false\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We also have a Sublime snippet for this, called <code>gitconfig</code>, that expands to this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo git config --system core.longpaths true &amp;&amp; sudo git config core.fileMode false &amp;&amp; sudo git config --global pager.status true &amp;&amp; sudo git config core.safecrlf false\n</code></pre>\n\n<h4 id=\"restrictingaccesstodevsites\">Restricting Access to Dev Sites</h4>\n\n<p>You may not want your dev sites to be accessible to just anyone. There's only one way to 100% keep your site off of search engines, and that's to make sure your site pulls up a login form no matter where the user lands.</p>\n\n<p>Accomplishing this with WordPress is super easy. First, you'll want to make sure the WordPress function <code>auth_redirect()</code> works on the front end of your site. It only works on the back end by default. Add this to your <code>functions.php</code> file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/* MAKE AUTH_REDIRECT WORK ON FRONT END */\nadd_filter( 'auth_redirect_scheme', 'wpse16975_check_loggedin' );\nfunction wpse16975_check_loggedin() {\n    return 'logged_in';\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, you can add <code>&lt;?php auth_redirect(); ?&gt;</code> to <code>header.php</code>. But only on the dev site! And be sure to commit your changes so they aren't overwritten on the next deploy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> You should also tell Git to ignore the <code>uploads</code> directory. Especially if your site is going to have a lot of them. If you bloat your repo too much Github and Bitbucket start restricting your access to it. Plus, it's just good practice to consider media as part of the site content/database. WP Sync DB has a <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-sync-db/wp-sync-db-media-files\">Media Files add-on</a> for transferring uploads to and from environments.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4 id=\"relatedposts\">Related Posts</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://zackphilipps.com/a-front-end-developers-daily-app-stack/\">A Front End Developer’s Daily App Stack</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://zackphilipps.com/a-front-end-developers-sublime-text-setup/\">A Front End Developer's Sublime Text Setup</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://zackphilipps.com/how-i-use-chrome-to-run-a-web-design-business/\">How I Use Chrome to Run a Web Design Business</a></li>\n</ul>","image":"/content/images/2015/07/19-1.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1435451914059,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1461255924304,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1438131716606,"published_by":1,"visibility":"public","mobiledoc":null},{"id":13,"uuid":"f870cf24-a700-4f67-adfc-a139482155e7","title":"Here Lies the Bucket List of Zack Philipps","slug":"here-lies-the-bucket-list-of-zack-philipps","markdown":"![Life experiences](/content/images/2015/08/photo-1431578500526-4d9613015464.jpeg)\n\nI made this because I needed to write down everything I want to do before I die, but also, it's important to consider everything I've done.

But all journeys come to an end. This one ends with an album called *Coma Ecliptic*.\n\nFor those of you that aren't familiar, BTBAM stands for Between the Buried and Me – my favorite band. They are a 5-person progressive metal outfit from Raleigh, North Carolina. If you are one of those people who hear \"metal\" and think \"Slipknot,\" then we're not on the same page. The metal that I know and love is a lot heavier and harder to play than any Slipknot song.\n\nIn fact, my appreciation for BTBAM is all about the sheer talent with which they play their instruments, and their songwriting prowess. I've always been into music. I play guitar, drums, and piano, and I can hit notes with my okay voice. Drums are my strong suit, and thus are the primary lens with which I view all music. I look for sophisticated rhythms and patterns above all else. BTBAM definitely delivers on those fronts, but they're so much more than that.\n\nSure, I can call them \"progressive metal,\" but they're so much more than a genre. These are a different class of musicians that can truly play anything. Well okay, Blake might not be the absolute fastest drummer in the land. If speed is the metric by which you judge music, then you're limiting yourself a whole lot. There's more to life than machine gun double bass. Besides, Blake is still pretty damn fast.\n\nSo why metal, you ask? Well, for one thing, they're obviously friends. Heavy music is something they all bond over. It's fun for them. Everyone except Tommy (the singer) could easily be a session musician within any genre and may even make more money doing it, but that would probably be boring. Staying in BTBAM means they get to create things as friends. They get to challenge each other and build relationships as human beings. Tommy could (and does) write his own solo music that's not metal, but again, I'm sure he enjoys the experience of being in such an innovative band with his close friends.\n\n**Side note:** What Tommy lacks in technical mastery of a single instrument, he makes up for in his storytelling.\n\n---\n\nI knew about BTBAM when they released their record *Alaska.* I didn't really get into it at the time. It's just not something my close friends listened to a lot. Someone showed me \"Selkies\" and I didn't really understand what happened after the intro. I didn't have as trained of an ear back then.\n\nWhat really drew me to BTBAM was the album *Colors.* It's basically one long song divided into 8 tracks that clocks in at a little over an hour. It's a masterpiece. I've seen talk online about how it's overrated, but it really isn't. I'm so grateful for the way that singular album has shaped my musical perspective.\n\n*Colors* is definitely a metal album, but it brings in several other genres like blues, jazz, post-rock, southern rock, and progressive rock. There are even multiple flavors of metal, like hardcore and death metal.\n\n*Colors* isn't perfect. The drum fills at the end of \"White Walls\" during the guitar solos are a bit contrived, for instance. That actually might be my only problem with it. But oh man, \"White Walls\" was the first song I heard from the album and it absolutely blew me away.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A2P3dIKo1969QtGB7U1cKie\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n\nAnyway, after I had listened to *Colors* countless times and started to get slightly bored of it, I dove in to the rest of BTBAM's catalogue. Turns out, they had been doing innovative stuff with metal all along. *Colors* had definitely been produced at the highest quality and had the best song structure(s), but even on their very first self-titled album they had been very experimental and mixed other genres with metal.\n\nI'll admit that I really only listen to two tracks off of *Between the Buried and Me,* and that's because they are the two that BTBAM included in their second set on *Colors Live.* The live versions of those songs are so much better.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A7KWE37VLtwlY6OWcDSIZST\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n\n*The Silent Circus* is a bit better in terms of production. It was at this point that BTBAM signed to Victory Records. A lot of those songs are actually pretty sinister. By that, I mean the music sounds evil and the lyrics are pretty badass too. I haven't listened to that album all the way through in a while; I should soon.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A20ww15KemlpsXO1KdiOigX\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n\n*Alaska* is better still, and that's the first album that drummer Blake Richardson, guitarist Dustie Waring, and bassist Dan Briggs appear on. So it appears that the two members really driving the experimentation from the beginning were vocalist Tommy Rogers and guitarist Paul Waggoner. But it wasn't until these three new members joined that the band became really tight and polished. *Alaska* reflects that. It also wasn't until *Alaska* that Tommy really matured vocally. It's super heavy, super experimental, and the production is great.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A2svPk1SpGvpRo8dM8nf6M8\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n\nSince we're talking about band members, it makes sense to mention the producer. Jamie King from The Basement Studios, located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina has produced almost all of BTBAM's albums. I think it's awesome that BTBAM was able to work with someone so close to home for most of their career, and that Jamie developed his talent alongside the band. The production unmistakably improves with each record (aside from *one* slight regression – more on that in the next two paragraphs).\n\n---\n\nAfter *Colors* and *Colors Live* comes *The Great Misdirect.* On the first listen through, I remember posting a Facebook status to the effect of, \"That was the best listening experience I've ever had.\" I purposefully limited my exposure to the hype of the album and so I was hearing 99% of it for the first time. \"Swim to the Moon,\" the last song on the 6-track album, was their best endeavor at song structure yet. I like to think of it as a modern-day *Rhapsody in Blue*. They did really cool things with \"Fossil Genera\" and \"Disease, Injury, Madness\" as well. And \"Mirrors\" is just plain beautiful.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A4yBg2OBVn8EaVAGL7CVy7c\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n\nThe more I listened to the album, however, the more disappointed I became. The production, I felt, was a step backward from *Colors.* Some of the recording felt rushed and imperfect. The songs had clear beginnings and ends, like all of their previous albums except *Colors.*\n\nTwo years later, BTBAM got signed to Metal Blade, and then came *The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues* – a 3-track EP that was released with the promise of a full-length counterpart in the near future. The first song, \"Specular Reflection,\" was another masterpiece! Probably their best one yet. That song exhibits a unique, expert use of motifs and reprises.\n\n**Motif:** a short succession of notes producing a single impression; a brief melodic or rhythmic formula out of which longer passages are developed.\n\n**Reprise:** a repeated passage in music.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A3t9glE2O1jHBUZqDqhJpZ5\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n\nTommy begins telling a story with this EP, presumably to be carried over into the full-length sequel. However, I did not get into the story because I was only *obsessed* with 1/3 of the EP.\n\n---\n\nIt wasn't until *The Parallax II: Future Sequence* that I really dove into Tommy's storytelling. I've got two words for you: space metal.\n\nThis album is the best of BTBAM. The songs once again have clear beginnings and ends, but there are several amazing motifs and reprises peppered throughout the album. (Besides, even on *Colors* you can hear the disconnect between songs, and not many people want to listen to an hour-long song anyway!) The heavy parts are **heavy** and the melodic parts are **melodic**, you know what I mean?\n\nTommy had included liner notes for his lyrics in the past, usually bundled with a special release of an album that included a live performance. *Colors Live* was one of them. So I did read those notes, and I've become obsessed with BTBAM lyrics in the past. I should refresh my memory because I've forgotten most of it. What I do remember is that Tommy's lyrics are often philosophical as opposed to a lot of metal lyrics, which are dick-swinging contests to see who can be the most grotesque. I remember being in high school, forming my own perspective on life, reading Tommy's lyrics, and being forced to think.\n\nBut it wasn't until I found [this series of posts](http://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2012/07/24/prognotes-between-the-buried-and-mes-the-parallax-part-i-introduction/) that I really knew how deep Tommy's lyrics ran. Turns out, the Parallax story had actually begun on the first track of *The Silent Circus*. So you have parts of their entire catalogue setting the stage for *Parallax II*. And what an epic conclusion *Parallax II* is. Here's a taste.\n\n> Regarding the concept of *The Parallax II: Future Sequence*, the new full-length album picks up where the 2011 EP, *The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues*, left off. The two main characters of the story take on a journey through space and time with the unenviable task of having to cure the flaws of humanity by any means necessary. While the EP served mostly as an introduction to the characters, *Future Sequence* contains the action of the story. The lyrics are written in the stream of consciousness style, which really helps to capture the perspective and emotion of the characters. We really enjoyed the challenge of writing this record, and I think we were all pleasantly surprised with how well the music and lyrics jived with one another. I couldn’t be happier with how *Future Sequence* turned out.\n\n> – Paul Waggoner\n\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A6f8nxx8zPqrctU6kLphyHS\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n\n---\n\nSo now we reach *Coma Ecliptic.* The overall style of the album is similar to *Parallax II:* songs with clear beginnings and ends, motifs and reprises that transcend songs, and one unifying story (which I still need to dive into). The album marks a clear evolution and maturity of the band's sound. The production is far and away the best of any BTBAM album. So... why is it so boring?\n\nIt's boring because of two main reasons. 1.) It's not as heavy, and 2.) it's more repetitive. Those two together mean that \"it's just not as metal, man.\" I've seen talk online about how \"BTBAM is basically prog rock now,\" and I'm sure some people would even go as far as saying they've sold out. I don't think so. I think they will definitely be able to reach a wider audience with *Coma Ecliptic,* which makes me happy for them. But for me, *Coma Ecliptic* just doesn't feel **familiar.**\n\nNot all of it is unfamiliar. Two songs remind me of BTBAM: \"The Ectopic Stroll\" and \"Memory Palace.\" And when I go see them live, I'll be hoping that they play those two songs and the rest will be old goodies. I'm so glad \"The Ectopic Stroll\" made the album. It represents the best of BTBAM, and truly is *Coma Ecliptic's* saving grace.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A7HttAGuRTcBF7Yz40kzlWh\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n\n---\n\nIf anything, *Coma Ecliptic* has made me appreciate *The Great Misdirect* for what it really is – a damn good album. I can't stop listening to \"Disease, Injury, Madness,\" and I now hold that song in the same regard I hold \"Specular Reflection.\"\n\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A0mrjr2OJ8MjWZnSXi3s4i9\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n\n---\n\nWhen BTBAM's next album comes out, I'll definitely give it a shot. But, I'm predicting that I will be disappointed. That doesn't mean I think BTBAM should go back to their old ways – I understand the change and how it benefits them, and I honestly couldn't be happier. Keep doin' you, fam.\n\nIn the meantime, for the first time in my life, I'll be that crotchety guy reminiscing about the good ol' days.","html":"<p><img src=\"/content/images/2016/03/Between-the-Buried-and-Me-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Between the Buried and Me\" /></p>\n\n<p>It's been a long journey. But all journeys come to an end. This one ends with an album called <em>Coma Ecliptic</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For those of you that aren't familiar, BTBAM stands for Between the Buried and Me – my favorite band. They are a 5-person progressive metal outfit from Raleigh, North Carolina. If you are one of those people who hear \"metal\" and think \"Slipknot,\" then we're not on the same page. The metal that I know and love is a lot heavier and harder to play than any Slipknot song.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, my appreciation for BTBAM is all about the sheer talent with which they play their instruments, and their songwriting prowess. I've always been into music. I play guitar, drums, and piano, and I can hit notes with my okay voice. Drums are my strong suit, and thus are the primary lens with which I view all music. I look for sophisticated rhythms and patterns above all else. BTBAM definitely delivers on those fronts, but they're so much more than that.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, I can call them \"progressive metal,\" but they're so much more than a genre. These are a different class of musicians that can truly play anything. Well okay, Blake might not be the absolute fastest drummer in the land. If speed is the metric by which you judge music, then you're limiting yourself a whole lot. There's more to life than machine gun double bass.
